# Smart Bin System
Dealing with collection dates can be problematic, people can be forgetful, and dealing with rubbish in general is something people dislike due to the smell and its foul nature. 

Therefore, we are developing a self-moving outdoor bin that moves to its collection point on collection day when it is filled. It will work by the bin being taught the position to reach, saving the path and then taking that path on the day that the specific bin needs to be collected.

It's primarily for students that already have enough on their plate with studies and exams. The bin service can be expanded to allow for more households or variety eventually.
